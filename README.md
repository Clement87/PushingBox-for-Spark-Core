Thank you for downloading the Spark source code for PushingBox.
Before you start don't forget to create an account on pushingbox.com, configure your services and create a scenario.


If you don't know what to do with your Spark why don't you connect it to your mailbox and be notify when you have new mail :)
or, create your own twittering cat door
or, connect it to your doorbell and received a push on your phone, even if you are not at home.
There is so much things you can do thanks to PushingBox,
I hope you enjoy the simplicity and the powerfulness of PushingBox :)
